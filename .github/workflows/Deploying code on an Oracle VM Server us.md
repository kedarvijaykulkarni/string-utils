Deploying code on an Oracle VM Server using GitHub Workflow involves a series of steps to automate the deployment process. GitHub Workflows allow you to define custom automation tasks for your repository. In this scenario, you would want to automate the deployment of your code to an Oracle VM Server whenever changes are pushed to your GitHub repository. Here's a general outline of the process:

1. **Set Up Your Oracle VM Server:**
   Make sure you have a properly configured Oracle VM Server to host and run your application.

2. **Configure Your GitHub Repository:**
   - Create a GitHub repository if you haven't already.
   - Push your code to the repository.

3. **Create a GitHub Workflow:**
   - Inside your repository, navigate to the "Actions" tab.
   - Click on "New workflow" or "Set up a workflow yourself" depending on your GitHub version.
   - This will open the workflow YAML file for editing.

4. **Define Your Workflow:**
   Here's a sample workflow YAML file that outlines the process. You might need to modify it according to your specific project structure and deployment requirements.

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to Oracle VM Server

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main  # Or the branch you want to trigger deployment from

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2

       - name: Deploy to Oracle VM Server
         run: |
           # Add your deployment steps here
           # For example, you might use SSH to copy files to the VM
           # and restart necessary services

   ```

5. **Define Deployment Steps:**
   In the `run` section of the workflow, you need to add the actual deployment steps. This might involve copying your code to the Oracle VM Server using SSH or any other method you prefer. Here's a generic example:

   ```yaml
   - name: Deploy to Oracle VM Server
     run: |
       ssh user@your-oracle-vm-server 'mkdir -p /path/to/deployment'
       scp -r ./path/to/your/code user@your-oracle-vm-server:/path/to/deployment/
       ssh user@your-oracle-vm-server 'cd /path/to/deployment && ./deploy_script.sh'
   ```

6. **SSH Key Setup:**
   For SSH-based deployments, you'll need to configure SSH keys for secure access. You can add your SSH private key as a GitHub repository secret and then use it in your workflow.

7. **Testing and Debugging:**
   Before fully relying on the workflow, test it with a simple deployment to ensure everything is working as expected. Check the workflow logs for any errors or issues.

8. **Enable the Workflow:**
   Once you're confident in your workflow, you can enable it. It will automatically run whenever changes are pushed to the specified branch.

Remember, this is a simplified guide. Depending on your specific setup and application requirements, you might need to customize the workflow further. Also, ensure that your deployment process is secure and doesn't expose sensitive information.
